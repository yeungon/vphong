**vPhong** is a phonetizer for Vietnamese orthography, is a folk implementation in Golang inspired by the original **vPhon** by [James Kirby](https://github.com/kirbyj/vPhon) (perhaps you might realize vPhon + Golang = vPhong). This software converts UTF-8 Vietnamese text into phonetic transcriptions using the International Phonetic Association (IPA) alphabet.

It (updated: the customized version doesn't) supports the three major dialects of Vietnamese: Northern (Hà Nội), Central (Huế), and Southern (Sài Gòn) speech. Building on the foundation of vPhon, vPhong aims to provide an efficient and modern implementation for phonetic transcription in the Go programming language.
